# mirrored-omnetSims

Software modeling and discrete event simulation is an essential tool for the study and analysis of complex systems. It can be used to address security and dependability properties, and to anticipate incidents. This repository includes some ongoing research simulations implemented  under the OMNeT++ (https://omnetpp.org/) framework to validate the application of novel concepts, methods, and techniques coming from wireless sensor and ad hoc network simulation scenarios.
